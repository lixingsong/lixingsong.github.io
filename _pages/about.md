I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu). Before joining Rose-Hulman, I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from [Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Notre Dame](http://cse.nd.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. Aaron Striegel](http://sites.nd.edu/aaron-striegel/). Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from [Ball State University, IN](https://www.bsu.edu/), under the mentorship of  [Prof. Shaoen Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaoenwu/), and I hold a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from [Wuhan University, China](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).


Research Interests
------
My current research centers around autonomous vehicles, reinforcement learning, and foundation model applications. I'm also enthusiastic about applying machine learning methodologies to multidisciplinary research. Prior to joining Rose-Hulman, my research portfolio included extensive work extensive work in wireless networking and mobile computing, with a particular emphasis on WiFi/LTE network bandwidth measurement and PHY/MAC cross-layer designs.

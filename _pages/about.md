I am currently an Assistant Professor at Computer Science and Software Engineering Department of [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu). Before joining Rose-Hulman, I obtained my Ph.D. in 2018 from [Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Notre Dame](http://cse.nd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Aaron Striegel](http://sites.nd.edu/aaron-striegel/).


Research Interest
------
My current research interests include autonomous driving, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I'm also generally interested in exploring machine learning solutions for real-world problems. Previously, I gained extensive research experience in the areas of wireless networking and mobile computing.
